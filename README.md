# Expo Constants.deviceId Undefined in Simulators/Emulators

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo `Constants.deviceId` property in simulators or emulators.  The `Constants.deviceId` often returns `undefined` or `null` in these environments, which can lead to unexpected app behavior or crashes.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution for handling this situation gracefully.

## Problem

The `Constants.deviceId` property, intended to provide a unique device identifier, may not function as expected in simulated environments. This is because simulators lack the hardware characteristics necessary for generating a unique ID.

## Solution

The recommended approach is to implement error handling that gracefully manages the possibility of `Constants.deviceId` being undefined or null. This ensures the application continues functioning without crashing.
